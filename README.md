# **Indigo**

What you're looking at is the most up to date version of Indigo's original PHP codebase that could be salvaged. I'm only uploading this because I support open source. Don't bother trying to "revive" it, it's unfinished, and will stay that way. I tried to add a few things for the fun of it almost a year ago but the code we put together is a mess and I'm really bad at PHP.

# **"What's Indigo?"**

Indigo WAS a social media network in a long chain of Miiverse "Clones" (Miiverse was a Nintendo operated social media network)

Initially, we used PHP as our code, until we merged with another clone, slaj/nova, using Nova's code and Indigo's styling. Eventaully, it was released, filled with tons of never before seen features on a clone, and it recieved a lot of users, but overall, a resounding "meh" or downright hatred. after it's closure, the community of clone users mostly died off, not with a bang, but with a wimper. Small pockets still exist, sadly, unable to accept that its over. 



Indigo's newer source, written in Golang, can be found here https://github.com/PF2M/Indigo

# Note: Do NOT try and "revive" Indigo, or any Miiverse clone. Please just let these memories die
