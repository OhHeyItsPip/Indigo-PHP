# **Indigo**

This is a archive of the PHP source code for Indigo. Initially, Ben, Chance, and I had developed the site in PHP, since that was the language we all knew the best. Eventually, the site merged with a competing site known as "Nova", and in exchange for keeping the Indigo name and layout, we would use the Golang codebase written for Nova. This is being uploaded to support open source, even if this was never finished. Ben had a more up to date version on his school computer, but he eventually had to wipe the hard drive and never backed the site up. This code is unfinished, buggy, and not very well optimized.

# **"What's Indigo?"**

Indigo was the last major release in a string of websites known as "Miiverse Clones", and was supposed to be the "Clone to end all clones". Miiverse was a website released by Nintendo and open from 2012-2017. Quite a few young and independent developers attempted to recreate the site, the most popular of these being Closedverse, run by Arian Kordi. Eventually, after switching to Golang and a few delays, Indigo released on October 27th, 2018, with most of the clone userbase switching to Indigo. It was the last major clone developed, while it was praised for new features such as polls, group chats, reposts, live posting, and more, the community at this point had become so overwhelmingly toxic that in February of 2019, the main developer, PF2M, had gotten doxxed by one of these users. This caused PF2M to shut down the site for good. The remaining userbase moved to Oasis, which was shut down in April of that same year. Along with that, Closedverse is shut down after the Cobb County Police sieze all computers from Arian's household due to alleged CP. That'really how the story ends. 


Indigo's newer source, written in Golang, can be found here https://github.com/PF2M/Indigo

# Note: Do NOT try and "revive" Indigo or any other "Miiverse Clone". Please just let these memories die. I have moved on and I hope you all do too.
